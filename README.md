# Statistical Data Analysis and Modeling in Python

This project applies core statistical methods using Python to explore real-world datasets and scenarios. It includes correlation analysis, experimental design, and probability modeling, implemented in a clear, reproducible format using Jupyter Notebook and standard scientific libraries.

## Project Scope

### 1. Correlation Analysis: Study Hours vs. Exam Scores
- Investigates the relationship between weekly study time and exam performance.
- Calculates and interprets both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients.
- Includes mean, standard deviation, covariance, and rank-based analysis.

### 2. Experimental Design: Blind Taste Test
- Designs and analyzes a blind taste test comparing two sodas.
- Emphasizes randomization, fairness, and controlled conditions.
- Includes setup, data collection, and result interpretation.

### 3. Probabilistic Modeling: Disease Screening Test
- Evaluates a diagnostic test using conditional probability and Bayes' theorem.
- Calculates sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
- Demonstrates how low prevalence affects test reliability.

## Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical reasoning and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization and reporting (via notebook cells)

## Repository Structure
- `study_exam_analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook with code, outputs, and interpretation
- `study_exam_analysis.py` – Python script version of the notebook
- `study_exam_analysis.pdf` – Exported report version for easy reading
- `README.md` – Project documentation
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## Notes
Originally developed for academic coursework and refactored for independent demonstration. All code and analysis are written from scratch, with emphasis on clarity, correctness, and reproducibility.
